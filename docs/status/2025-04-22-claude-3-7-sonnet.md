## Accomplishments Today

1. **PR Review System Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive role-based PR review system (PR #48)
   - Implemented four reviewer roles: engineer, manager, SRE, director
   - Added configuration-driven approach for role responsibilities and file patterns
   - Implemented critical path detection for security and architecture files

2. **Workflow Improvements**
   - Addressed issue #46 for better PR management and reduced merge conflicts
   - Enhanced Makefile with PR review commands
   - Added script for role-based reviews with specialized checks
   - Created documentation for PR review process

3. **Proposal for Claude Rules Restructuring**
   - Developed proposal for modular structure of Claude rules
   - Created proof-of-concept implementation of `.claude/rules/` directory
   - Implemented compilation script for generating CLAUDE.md from modular files
   - Documented approach for reducing merge conflicts on CLAUDE.md

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Merge Conflicts**
   - Multiple PRs modifying CLAUDE.md caused merge conflicts
   - Needed to develop specialized approach for modular rules
   - Required careful consideration of existing branch structure

2. **Config Format Design**
   - Designed JSON configuration structure for PR reviewer roles
   - Balanced flexibility with simplicity in role definitions
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing workflow

## Next Steps

1. **Complete PR Reviews**
   - Merge PR #48 for role-based PR reviews
   - Review and merge other outstanding PRs using new system
   - Test role-based PR reviews with different roles

2. **Implement Claude Rules System**
   - Fully implement the proposed modular rules structure
   - Migrate existing CLAUDE.md content to separate rule files
   - Create proper tooling for rule compilation

3. **Enhance Testing and Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive tests for PR review system
   - Document usage patterns and extension points
   - Create examples for different reviewer roles

## Blockers

- Need to coordinate branch naming standards across team
- Manage multiple PRs affecting the same files
- Ensure backwards compatibility with existing workflows

## Conclusion

Today's work focused on improving the PR review process with role-based reviews and addressing the merge conflict issues with CLAUDE.md. The proposed modular rules system should significantly reduce conflicts and make the codebase more maintainable. The PR review system adds structure and ensures the right people are reviewing the right parts of the code.
