## Project Status Overview

The `isolated-pymcp` project repository has been successfully initialized and populated with core implementation files. This project creates a secure, isolated environment for exploring Python development with Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Language Server Protocol (LSP).

## Work Completed

1. **Repository Setup and Structure**
   - Initialized Git repository with main branch
   - Created appropriate directory structure for project components
   - Set up comprehensive README.org with project overview

2. **Documentation**
   - Created CLAUDE.md with tailored guidelines for AI agents working with the codebase
   - Added SETUP.org for literate programming approach to implementation
   - Added SETUP_NOTES.md with instructions for tangling org files
   - Added References section with comprehensive links to MCP and LSP resources

3. **Core Implementation**
   - Created Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for container infrastructure
   - Implemented scripts for starting and testing MCP servers
   - Added sample Python algorithms (fibonacci, factorial, primes) with multiple implementation strategies
   - Developed test suites for all algorithms
   - Configured LSP integration via MultilspyLSP
   - Set up Emacs integration for isolated-pymcp
   - Added project configuration files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, pytest.ini)

4. **Collaboration Infrastructure**
   - Set up GitHub repository (aygp-dr/isolated-pymcp)
   - Added collaborators (daidaitaotao, kkumar30, jwalsh) with write access
   - Created key issue labels (architecture, security, mcp, lsp)
   - Filed 10 prioritized implementation issues
   - Created onboarding issues for each collaborator

5. **Development Workflow**
   - Implemented literate programming approach using org-mode
   - Added tangle/detangle Makefile targets
   - Created `tangle-setup.sh` script for collaborators
   - Configured `.gitattributes` to mark generated files

## Testing Status

- Core infrastructure components are in place but require testing in a real container environment
- Makefile contains appropriate targets for testing MCP servers
- Test scripts are implemented but need to be executed in the container
- Sample algorithm implementations include built-in benchmarks
- Pytest-based test suite is implemented but needs execution

## Next Steps

1. **Container Infrastructure**
   - Build and test the Docker container (Issue #1)
   - Verify port mappings and connectivity
   - Test container isolation and security boundaries

2. **MCP Server Implementation**
   - Implement and test the Run-Python MCP server (Issue #3)
   - Develop MultilspyLSP bridge for code intelligence (Issue #4)
   - Create shell scripts for MCP server testing (Issue #6)

3. **LSP Integration**
   - Set up Python LSP server integration (Issue #2)
   - Test code intelligence features (completion, diagnosis)
   - Integrate with MultilspyLSP bridge

4. **Client Tools**
   - Implement Claude Code CLI integration (Issue #7)
   - Test Emacs integration with mcp.el (Issue #10)
   - Develop algorithm analysis workflow (Issue #8)

5. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Test and ensure FreeBSD compatibility (Issue #9)
   - Verify script compatibility across platforms

## Blockers and Issues

No significant blockers identified at this stage. The repository is ready for active development based on the prioritized issues.

## Conclusion

The `isolated-pymcp` project has been successfully initialized with a comprehensive framework for development. The literate programming approach using org-mode provides a solid foundation for maintainable and well-documented code. The next phase will focus on implementing the core MCP and LSP servers and testing their integration.
