## Accomplishments Today

1. **MCP Emacs Integration**
   - Implemented comprehensive MCP Emacs integration tutorial in `tutorials/mcp-emacs/`
   - Created detailed README.md with quick start guide and feature overview
   - Added installation instructions (INSTALL.md) and dependency checking script
   - Implemented Makefile for easy setup and server management
   - Included example files for different use cases (basic usage, org-babel integration, etc.)
   - Enhanced troubleshooting tools for server diagnostics
   - Closed issue #70 for MCP Emacs Integration RFC

2. **Codebase Reorganization**
   - Migrated shell and Python helper scripts from root directory to `scripts/`
   - Standardized naming conventions (kebab-case for shell scripts, snake_case for Python)
   - Updated file imports and cross-references to maintain functionality
   - Modified Makefile references to use the new script locations
   - Removed original script files after successful migration
   - Closed issue #69 for script migration

3. **MCP Integrations Configuration**
   - Added comprehensive MCP integration configuration in `integrations/` directory
   - Created configuration files for VS Code, Emacs, shell, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor
   - Implemented core MCP configuration and server definitions
   - Added examples for basic usage, Python isolation, and memory storage
   - Created Makefile for MCP integrations setup and management
   - Closed issue #67 for MCP integrations configuration

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Path References**
   - Updating import paths in migrated Python scripts required careful validation
   - Ensuring Makefile targets properly referenced new script locations
   - Maintaining backward compatibility with existing code

2. **Integration Cross-Compatibility**
   - Ensuring consistent configuration across different environments
   - Balancing environment-specific features with consistent core functionality
   - Managing dependency paths for proper script execution

3. **Documentation Consistency**
   - Keeping documentation aligned with implementation across multiple files
   - Ensuring README files properly reflect available features
   - Maintaining consistent style and organization in documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Update Main README**
   - Update main README.md to reflect new tutorials and integrations
   - Document script directory reorganization
   - Add references to new MCP integration configurations

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Run comprehensive tests across all migrated components
   - Verify MCP Emacs integration in different environments
   - Ensure all Makefile targets work with reorganized scripts

3. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for MCP integration usage
   - Add troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Update developer guide with new organization structure

## Blockers

- CLAUDE.md has uncommitted changes that need to be resolved
- Main branch is 4 commits ahead of origin/main and needs to be pushed
- May need to update any CI/CD scripts that reference root-level scripts

## Conclusion

Today's work focused on improving code organization, enhancing integration options, and providing better documentation. The migration of scripts to a dedicated directory improves maintainability, while the new MCP integrations configuration provides consistent setup across multiple environments. The MCP Emacs integration tutorial offers a comprehensive guide for users wanting to use MCP with Emacs, enhancing the project's overall usability.
