## Testing Strategy for Claude Slash Commands

To test the slash commands, follow this checklist:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Ensure Claude Code CLI is properly installed
   - Verify Claude API key is configured
   - Check that repository contains the `.claude` directory structure

2. **Basic Command Verification**
   - Run `/project:code:analyze` to test basic analysis functionality
   - Check that response references data from `.claude/.cache/repo-context.json`
   - Verify that output includes architecture information and component relationships

3. **Algorithm-Specific Testing**
   - Test `/project:code:optimize algorithms/fibonacci.py` for algorithm-specific analysis
   - Verify that hotspots from `.claude/.cache/analysis/hotspots.json` are referenced
   - Check that recommendations are relevant to the algorithm implementation

4. **Diagram Generation Testing**
   - Test `/project:code:diagram architecture` command
   - Verify that the diagram references structure from `.claude/.cache/diagrams/`
   - Check that important components and relationships are represented

5. **Review Functionality Testing**
   - Test `/project:code:review algorithms/` for multi-file review
   - Verify that analysis correctly identifies interactions between files
   - Check that code quality assessment is provided

6. **Security Analysis Testing**
   - Test `/project:code:security algorithms/` command
   - Verify that security considerations specific to algorithms are identified
   - Check that recommendations follow security best practices

## Conclusion

Today's work established a comprehensive framework for static analysis that enhances Claude Code's ability to understand and visualize the codebase. The implementation of standardized slash commands and GitHub Actions integration creates a seamless workflow for algorithm analysis and code quality assessment. The follow-up issues provide a clear roadmap for completing the remaining framework components, ensuring continued improvement of the analysis capabilities. The testing strategy provides a structured approach to verifying the functionality of all implemented components.
