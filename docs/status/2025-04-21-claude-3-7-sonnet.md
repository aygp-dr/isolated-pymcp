## Today's Work Plan

Based on the status report from 2025-04-20 and the current open GitHub issues, today's focus will be on advancing core infrastructure components and implementing initial MCP server integrations.

### Priority Tasks

1. **Container Build and Test**
   - Build and test Docker container (Issue #1)
   - Verify port mappings and server connectivity
   - Implement security boundaries for isolation (Issue #5)

2. **MCP Server Implementation**
   - Implement core Run-Python MCP server (Issue #3)
   - Test MCP server scripts
   - Develop MultilspyLSP bridge (Issue #4)

3. **Algorithm Analysis Workflow**
   - Implement end-to-end algorithm analysis (Issue #8)
   - Test with sample algorithms (fibonacci, factorial, primes)
   - Document analysis workflow

4. **FreeBSD Compatibility** 
   - Ensure all scripts maintain cross-platform compatibility (Issue #9)
   - Test container commands with both Docker and Podman
   - Verify FreeBSD-specific customizations

### Secondary Tasks

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Ensure comprehensive MCP server documentation
   - Update README with practical usage examples
   - Add status reports for tracking progress

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Expand test coverage for core components
   - Add specific tests for MCP server boundaries
   - Document testing approach

3. **Emacs Integration**
   - Begin implementing Emacs integration if time permits (Issue #10)
   - Focus on basic MCP connectivity

## Current Blockers

- Need to verify all environment variables are properly configured
- May require additional testing on FreeBSD platform
- Need to coordinate with team members on their specific onboarding tasks

## End-of-Day Goals

By the end of today, we aim to have:
1. A functional Docker container with working MCP servers
2. Initial implementation of algorithm analysis workflow
3. Confirmation of FreeBSD compatibility
4. Updated documentation reflecting current implementation status
