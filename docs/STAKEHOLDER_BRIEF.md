# Isolated Python MCP (Machine Control Protocol) - Stakeholder Brief

## Executive Summary
The Isolated Python MCP project provides a secure, containerized environment for executing Python code using the Machine Control Protocol (MCP). This solution enables safe execution of AI-generated or third-party Python code with strict isolation, comprehensive monitoring, and controlled resource access. The system is designed for organizations requiring high security standards when integrating AI assistants with their development workflows.

## Business Context
As AI code generation becomes increasingly prevalent in software development, organizations face significant security challenges when executing untrusted code. Current solutions lack proper isolation, resource control, and security monitoring, creating potential vulnerabilities. This project addresses these gaps with a production-ready isolation framework specifically optimized for Python MCP interactions.

## Stakeholders
- **Engineering Leadership**: Responsible for secure integration of AI tools into development workflows
- **Security Teams**: Concerned with preventing security vulnerabilities from AI-generated code
- **Development Teams**: End users who benefit from safe AI code execution
- **DevOps/Platform Teams**: Responsible for deploying and maintaining the infrastructure
- **Compliance/Risk Management**: Ensuring adherence to organizational security policies

## Strategic Objectives
1. Eliminate security risks associated with executing untrusted Python code
2. Provide isolated environments with configurable resource limits
3. Enable comprehensive monitoring and logging of all executed code
4. Seamlessly integrate with existing AI assistant workflows
5. Support cross-platform compatibility (Linux, FreeBSD)
6. Maintain high performance despite isolation measures

## Success Metrics
- Zero security incidents related to AI-generated code execution
- 100% isolation of untrusted code execution
- <50ms overhead for containerized execution compared to native
- Successful integration with at least 3 major AI code assistant platforms
- Comprehensive audit logs for all executed code

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (2-3 months)**: Core isolation infrastructure and MCP integration
- **Phase 2 (1-2 months)**: Enhanced monitoring, logging, and resource controls
- **Phase 3 (1-2 months)**: Enterprise features and third-party integrations

## Budget Implications
- Infrastructure costs: $5,000-10,000/year (cloud resources for testing/CI)
- Development team: 3-4 FTEs for initial development
- Ongoing maintenance: 1-2 FTEs

## Dependencies
- Docker/containerization infrastructure
- MCP server implementation
- Python runtime environment
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
