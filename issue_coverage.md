# Add Code Coverage Tracking to CI/CD Pipeline

## Description
We need to implement code coverage tracking and historical reporting in our CI/CD pipeline. This will help us identify untested code paths and improve our overall test quality.

## Requirements
- Set up pytest-cov for code coverage measurement
- Configure GitHub Actions to run coverage tests on each PR
- Generate coverage reports in both HTML and XML formats
- Add coverage badges to README.org
- Store historical coverage data to track trends over time 
- Alert on coverage decreases in PRs

## Implementation Steps
1. Add pytest-cov and coverage dependencies to development requirements
2. Create a proper GitHub Actions workflow for Python testing
3. Configure coverage thresholds for different parts of the codebase
4. Set up coverage comment generation on PRs
5. Implement a coverage history storage mechanism
6. Create visualization for coverage trends

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Coverage reports generated automatically on each PR
- [ ] Coverage badge visible in README.org
- [ ] Minimum 80% overall code coverage requirement enforced
- [ ] History of coverage metrics stored and accessible
- [ ] PRs that decrease coverage are flagged for review

## Notes
This should utilize GitHub Actions and integrate with our existing make-based build system. Coverage reports should be stored as artifacts and also be accessible via a simple UI.
