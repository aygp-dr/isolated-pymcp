# Pydantic AI and MCP Run Python Tutorial Workshop

## Overview

Create a 4-hour workshop tutorial for getting started with Pydantic AI and MCP Run Python. This tutorial will be written in org-mode and will include practical exercises, code examples, and integration with our existing algorithms.

## Requirements

1. Create a comprehensive org-mode document that can be tangled to generate usable code and scripts
2. Cover installation of both Pydantic AI and setup of MCP Run Python
3. Include practical examples using our existing factorial, fibonacci, and prime number algorithms
4. Provide a web application example for integration with Flask
5. Include troubleshooting section and exercise solutions

## References

- [Pydantic AI Installation Guide](https://ai.pydantic.dev/install/#__tabbed_2_2)
- [MCP Run Python GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/mcp-run-python)
- [MCP Run Python Documentation](https://ai.pydantic.dev/mcp/run-python/)

## Deliverables

- Full org-mode document with tangle blocks
- Working code examples
- Flask web application for integration
- Export to PDF functionality

## Timeline

This should be completed within 2 weeks to be incorporated into our next training cycle.

## Additional Notes

The tutorial should balance theory with hands-on practice, ensuring participants understand not just how to use the tools but why they're useful for our specific use cases.

## Current Status

A draft tutorial has been created in:
- `/tutorials/pydantic-mcp/pydantic-mcp-tutorial.org`

This org-mode file can be tangled to generate all necessary code files. The tutorial is structured as a 4-hour workshop with the following sections:

1. Setting up the Environment (30 min)
2. Understanding MCP Basics (30 min)
3. Running Python Code with MCP (1 hour)
4. Implementing Custom Solutions (1 hour)
5. Integration with Existing Applications (1 hour)

Each section includes practical examples and exercises that utilize our existing algorithms (factorial, fibonacci, primes).
