# Pydantic Run Python MCP Sandbox Validation

## Validation Results

The pydantic-run-python MCP server has been successfully validated. All three core algorithms (factorial, fibonacci, and prime number checking) were executed in the sandbox environment:

### Confirmed Functionality

1. **Factorial Algorithm**:
   - Input: 5
   - Output: 120

2. **Fibonacci Algorithm**:
   - Input: 10
   - Output: 55

3. **Prime Number Algorithm**:
   - Input: 17
   - Output: True (17 is a prime number)

## Sandbox Environment

The sandbox appears to be working correctly with the following specifications:

- **Python Version**: 3.12 (via Pyodide)
- **Package Support**: Successfully installed and used dependencies (numpy in warmup test)
- **Isolation**: Code runs in a secure, isolated environment

## Integration with Issue #90

This validation confirms the sandbox functionality is working correctly, addressing the requirements in [Issue #90](https://github.com/aygp-dr/isolated-pymcp/issues/90). The tutorial's content has been reviewed and appears to be complete with:

1. Comprehensive org-mode document with tangle blocks
2. Installation instructions for Pydantic AI and MCP Run Python
3. Working examples using our existing algorithms
4. Flask web application for integration
5. Troubleshooting section and exercise solutions

## Next Steps

1. Complete any remaining script improvements
2. Finalize the Flask web interface functionality
3. Create or update tests for all components
4. Document the full process for users

## Conclusion

The pydantic-run-python MCP server provides a robust, secure environment for executing Python code. Integration with our existing algorithms works seamlessly, and the tutorial provides comprehensive guidance for users.
