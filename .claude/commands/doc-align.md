# Documentation Alignment

Analyze the consistency between documentation files and code in this repository:

1. **Check for inconsistencies between**:
   - README.org file
   - CLAUDE.md file
   - Makefile targets
   - Shell scripts in scripts/

2. **Verify that**:
   - All Makefile targets are documented in README.org
   - All shell scripts have corresponding documentation
   - Usage instructions are consistent across files
   - Command parameters match between docs and implementation

3. **Identify gaps in**:
   - Missing documentation for existing functionality
   - Outdated documentation that no longer matches implementation
   - Commands mentioned in docs but not implemented

Provide a concise summary of findings and specific recommendations for alignment.
